# Introduction

This is the prototyping docs made for uRyde API endpoints, which will allow you to post rides and get rides in our database

We currently own have docs the shell scripts up, but hope to have other languages soon


# Authentication

> To authorize, use this code:

```ruby
Coming Soon..
```

```python
Coming Soon..
```

```shell
# With shell, you can just pass the correct header with each request
curl "api_endpoint_here"
-H "Authorization: <ApiKey>"
```

```javascript
Coming Soon..
```

> Make sure to replace `<ApiKey>` with your API key.

<aside class="notice">
You must replace <code>meowmeowmeow</code> with your personal API key.

## Get All Rides

```

```python

```

```shell
curl "http://example.com/api/rides"
